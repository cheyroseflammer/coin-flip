# Coin Flip Application

This React exercise gives you some practice working with props, defaultProps, state, and simple click events in React.

- The user should be able to click on a button to flip a coin. Every time the user clicks, the coin gets flipped again. The app should also keep track of how many times heads and tails have shown up.

## Preview of app in action
